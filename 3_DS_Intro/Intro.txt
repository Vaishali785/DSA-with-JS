~ Data Structure is a collection of values, a way to organize our data. We can put data in it and retrieve data from it.
There are tons of DS, some are useful for some operations and others are good for other operations.

~ We have storage also (hard disk etc), but this storage is very slow and it takes a lot of time for CPU to access data from here.
But RAM is very fast that's why our variables are stored in RAM.

~ Some DS are pre-built in languages, and all the languages have different pre-built DS. But if requires some specific DS which is not already there, we can create them.

~ Operations on DS:
    1. Insertion
    2. Deletion
    3. Traversal 
    4. Searching 
    5. Sorting
    6. Access
