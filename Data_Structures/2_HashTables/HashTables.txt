* Hash Tables - Also called as  
    -Hash Maps, 
    -Dictionary in Python,
    -Maps in Java , 
    -Hashes in Ruby, 
    -Unordered Maps, 
    -Objects
    -Objects, Map, Sets in JS are examples of hash tables.

* Hash Functions 
    -Takes a string(input) and converts it to a random pattern. 
    -For same input output is always same. 
    -We can't identify from the output, what the input was.

? In JS, when we store a key-value pair in object, we pass this to a hash function, which returns a memory address location and store the key-value to that location.
? This hash function is very very fast. Usually, time complexity of this hash function is O(1).


* Advantage of Hash Tables
    1. Lookup - O(1)
    2. Insertion - O(1)
    3. Deletion - O(1)
    4. Search - O(1)

! Disadvantages of Hash Tables 
    1. Collision - As our memory is limited sometimes hash tables store multiple data on one location, 
                    making it difficult to access it. -- O(n)
    2. It is difficult to access all the keys than from an array.
    3. It is unordered.


* Object vs Map vs Set
    Object can store only strings as keys 
    In map, anything can be stored as a key - string,number etc.
    Sets Only store keys and not key-value pair.
