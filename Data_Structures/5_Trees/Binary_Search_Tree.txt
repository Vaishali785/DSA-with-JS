* Rules of Binary Search Tree
    1. Left means decreasing , right means increasing .
    2.  Each node should have max of two child as it is a binary tree.

* Operations on Binary Search Tree 
    1. Lookup - O(log n)
    2. Insert - O(log n)
    3. Delete - O(log n)                  

?Note:- Binary Search tree is preferred until it is balanced, as it gets unbalanced all our operations turn to O(n) as an unbalanced tree is almost similar to linked list.


* Pros  
1. Better than O(n)
2. Ordered
3. Flexible Size 

!Cons 
1. It is always O(log n) and never O(1) as in arrays and other DS.
