*** Recursion is not an algorithm but its a concept, a very important concept.
1. Identify the base case (or stop point). 
2. Identify the recursive case.
3. Get closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you have 2 returns.

* When to use Recursion? 
~ Rule to use recursion is use recursion when you don't know how deep a DS is, when you don't know how many loops are required.
~ Every time you are using a tree or converting something into a tree, consider recursion.
~ Divide and Conquer using Recursion
~ Use in sorting

* Pros
~ Keeps code DRY
~ Readabilty 

! Cons 
~ Large stack
